# Logic Circuit Simulation

This repository contains a logic circuit simulation implemented using Logisim, a digital logic circuit simulator. The simulation aims to replicate a simple game scenario and consists of two main parts A and B:

## Overview

The final circuit consists of two subcircuits: one for Part A, labeled as "logic P=Q," and one for Part B, labeled as "counter."
Part A of the circuit is responsible for performing logical operations between two variables, P and Q, which can range from 0 to 7. Various operations such as addition, subtraction, and comparison are implemented. The logic is based on the relationships P = Q+1, P = Q-1, P = Q+2, and P = Q-2. By combining inputs of Q using OR gates and combining Q inputs with P inputs ranging from 0-7 using AND gates, successful combinations yield an output of 1.

Part B of the circuit utilizes a counter to count successful and unsuccessful combinations produced by Part A. A button input is used to count items, maintaining connectivity to the main circuit. A NOT gate is employed for counting purposes. Additionally, a comparator with a constant value of 3 resets the counter after three unsuccessful combinations, while another comparator with a constant value of 6, followed by a D flip-flop, controls the simulation by stopping it after six successful combinations.

## Implementation Details

- A 3-to-8 bit decoder is used to decode the values of P and Q, as they can range from 0-7.
- OR gates are used to combine inputs of Q, while AND gates are used to combine Q inputs with P inputs ranging from 0-7.
- A NOT gate is utilized for counting successful and unsuccessful combinations.
- Comparators with constant values of 3 and 6, along with a D flip-flop, are used for controlling the simulation.

## Part A: Logic Operations (P=Q)

In this part, the circuit performs various logical operations between two variables, P and Q, which can range from 0 to 7. The operations include addition, subtraction, and comparison. Different combinations of P and Q are analyzed, and corresponding output signals are generated.

## Part B: Counter and Simulation Control

Part B of the circuit involves counting successful and unsuccessful combinations generated by Part A. It utilizes a counter, a button for input, and comparators to determine when to reset the counter or stop the simulation based on predefined criteria.
