# Logic Circuit Simulation

This repository contains a logic circuit simulation implemented using Logisim, a digital logic circuit simulator. The simulation aims to replicate a simple game scenario and consists of two main parts:

## Part A: Logic Operations (P=Q)

In this part, the circuit performs various logical operations between two variables, P and Q, which can range from 0 to 7. The operations include addition, subtraction, and comparison. Different combinations of P and Q are analyzed, and corresponding output signals are generated.

## Part B: Counter and Simulation Control

Part B of the circuit involves counting successful and unsuccessful combinations generated by Part A. It utilizes a counter, a button for input, and comparators to determine when to reset the counter or stop the simulation based on predefined criteria. 

## Usage

To run the simulation:
1. Download and install Logisim from [here](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html).
2. Open Logisim and load the provided circuit file.
3. Run the simulation to observe the behavior of the logic circuit.

Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements or adding new features to the logic circuit simulation.
